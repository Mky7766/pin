            <p>
                A Snow Day Calculator is an online tool designed to predict the probability of your school closing due to winter weather. By analyzing various factors like forecasted snowfall, timing, ice, and temperature, it gives you a percentage chance of having a day off. It's a fun and useful way to anticipate whether you'll be building a snowman or heading to class.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">How It Works: The Science Behind the Prediction</h2>
            <p>
                Our Snow Day Calculator isn't just a random number generator. It analyzes several key data points to provide a reliable school closure prediction:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your ZIP code tells the calculator which weather forecasts and school district policies to consider.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Forecasts:</strong> The tool pulls data from reliable weather services, looking at expected snowfall amounts, wind chill, and ice warnings.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing of Snowfall:</strong> A foot of snow overnight is more likely to cause a closure than a few flurries during the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Type of School:</strong> Public schools, private schools, and universities often have different thresholds for closing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">How to Use the Calculator</h2>
            <p>Using the tool is simple:</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Enter Your ZIP Code:</strong> This helps us get the most accurate weather forecast for your area.</li>
                <li><strong>Select Your School Type:</strong> Choose whether your school is public, private, or another type.</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Calculate:</strong> Let our algorithm do the work! You'll instantly see your percentage chance of a snow day.</li>
            </ol>
